# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) — C, C++ & Python

Welcome to my public DSA repository!  
In this repository , i am learning DSA in C and C++ by the playlist of CodeWithHarry(https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9ahIappRPN0MCAgtOu3lQjQi&si=FbPubpCM9ZfMLjAh). This playlist covers almost whole DSA, but the main point is that i am learning it in the python also, beacause ultimately my focus is to master python, but due to the semester exams i have to study it in C and C++

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each subfolder contains:
- ✅ C or C++ code
- 🐍 Python code
- 📄 Clear file naming
- 🧠 README.md (for guiding you to how to run the program)

| Folder Name       | Description |

## 🚀 How to Use 

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Open the folder in **VS Code**.

3. Install the **Code Runner** extension in VS Code (if not already installed).  
   - Just search for **"Code Runner"** in the Extensions panel and click **Install**.

4. Open any `.c`, `.cpp`, or `.py` file you want to run.

5. Click the **"Run Code"** button in the top-right corner of VS Code  
   *(or right-click inside the code editor and choose “Run Code”)*.

6. That’s it — your code will run in the terminal at the bottom.

💡 You can also run:
- C/C++ files manually using `gcc` or an IDE like CodeBlocks.  
  Example: `gcc file.c -o file && ./file`
- Python files using:
  ```bash
  python filename.py
  ```
